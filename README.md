Flippy, for closer communities

The project is an android application called Flippy.
The application has a logo in the folder

How the applcation Works::::::::::::::::

The application requires a user sign up. 
The user then chooses a community which he belongs to, after which he can subscribe to channels in that community.
When a user subscribe to the channel,  the user receives updates of posts and notices that ate posted in that
channel. Finally the user can unsubscribe to a channel after subscription

Any user can create a channel and as well any user can belong to any channel.
A channel has at most five administrators who have the right to manage the channel. 
An administrator to a channel can create notices an post in a channel.
